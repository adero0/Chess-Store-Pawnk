A well-structured chess store that is built with modularity in mind.

Jwt, purchase processing, adjustable content main page carousel as some neat things this app has.
The current version uses mail hog for emails and postgresql for the database but the application.properties allow for changing it.

The app is built using Spring Boot for the backend and React TS for the frontend.
